# :robot: Android Roadmap
![Android Cover](images/Android%20Cover.png)
A roadmap for android developers that can guide you from the very basics of the track and help you improve your skills.

**First of all, we have to talk about**
## :green_book: Why should you learn Android development?
![Android Devices](images/Android%20Devices.png)
With over 3 billion Android devices all over the world including:
( :iphone: Smartphones,
:tv: TVs,
:watch: Smartwatches,
:car: Cars and more)
in the hands of 2.5 billion users, it has become essential for companies to develop Android apps for their services.

Before starting with Android you have to learn a programming language and because it's Android, we recommend you start learning with Java.

---

## But.. Why Java? :thinking:
- Most the open-source projects are written in Java.
- Java has been the preferred language for Android development until May 2019
- Most of the Stack Overflow answers are written in Java
- Most Android libraries are written in Java, and to be able to use them, you have to understand Java.

## Learning Java:

### :paperclip: Resources:

#### `Arabic:`
1. [Java baiscs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AajYlZGzU_LVrHdoouf8W6ZN)
2. [OOP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCInYL3l2AagY7fFlhCrjpLiIFybW3yQv)

#### `English (Udacity):`
1. [Java basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282)
2. [OOP](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283)

## Before moving to the next level you have to make sure that you understand these topics:
- Basic syntax
- Conditions (if - switch)
- Looping (for - while - do While)
- Arrays & Collections 
- Exception handling (try-catch)
- OOP
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- :clipboard: **Build a simple project with Java**

## Android basics:
Now you are ready to start programming real Android apps for that you will need a good IDE to help you in your journey and I recommend you use Android studio.

![Android development](images/Android%20Development.png)

We will start with the basics of the basics :sweat_smile:

Then you will need to learn how to reuse portions of your app's UI by using fragments and navigation component.

### :paperclip: Resources:
* Fragments: [Arabic Next Trend](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL25WpelterbakuEfYt-G-TzzzzIOAZQbK)

## Before moving to the next level you have to make sure that you understand these topics:
- Design responsive android UI using XML
- Accepting user inputs
- Developing multi-screen applications
- Making big lists of data without using many resources using recyclerview
- Fragments
- Navigation component
  - Using the Navigation graph
  - Navigating between fragments
  - Using Drawer layout and Bottom Navigation
  - Using safe args

## Kotlin:
After building a strong foundation with java and XML basics we will start building on it with the knowledge we will really use in our future applications.

![Kotlin](images/Kotlin.png)
### So... Why Kotlin?
After Google I/O 2017 where Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android, Kotlin has become used by more and more Android developers and now it's used by over 60% of professional Android developers, for that each Android developer must learn it. [Learn More](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)

We will start by learning the basics of the language.

## Before moving to the next level you have to make sure that you understand these topics:
- The basic syntax of Kotlin
- Null safety concept
- Looping
- Functions and different types of them *inline, infix, extension, etc.*
- Types in Kotlin
- Companion objects
- Higher-order functions
- Operations on collections *filter, map etc.*
- Generics
- :clipboard: **Build a console app to apply the skills you have learned in this level**

## Android Intermediate:
Now we will start writing Android apps using the skills we have learned in the previous levels as we will use Kotlin we've just learned with the Android skills we have built before to make much powerful and usable Android apps.
